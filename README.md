# Interactive Game - Scratch Project

## Description
This is an interactive game created using Scratch. The player controls two objects: a **ball** and a **star**. The goal is to click on the **ball** to earn points. With each click, the ball speeds up, making the game more challenging. The **star** appears randomly and plays a sound when clicked. The game has a 30-second countdown timer, and when the time ends, the game stops and displays a **"Game Over"** message.
